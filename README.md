I'm a software developer with an interest in system architecture 🏗️, concurrency ⚙️, and language design 💻. I enjoy exploring how things work behind the scenes and applying that knowledge to build efficient and practical solutions. ✨

Feel free to take a look at my repositories or reach out — I'm always happy to discuss interesting ideas or collaborate on projects! 🌱
