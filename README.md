Hi there, I'm Ariel! 👋

I'm a software developer with an interest in system architecture, concurrency, and language design. I enjoy exploring how things work behind the scenes and applying that knowledge to build efficient and practical solutions.

Feel free to take a look at my repositories or reach out—I'm always happy to discuss interesting ideas or collaborate on projects.
